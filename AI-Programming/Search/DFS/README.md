# DFS-with-Pygame

This repo solves the question below creating with Pygame animation.
We found all possible ways to **ending square** and display it on the Pygame UI
### Question

You are given an m Ã— n integer array grid where grid [i][j] could be:
-  1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- 2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- 0 representing empty squares we can walk over.
- -1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

### Usage
Before running the main code, you can give specific 2D matrix. 

``` python main.py ``` 

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute. I am working on creating a WebAssembly script that will enable displaying output in the browser. In next, I will add other path-finding and search algorithms with animations.
