    - Adversarial search and games
        - MiniMax, alpha-beta pruning

#### Python programming concepts
- Object oriented programming in Python
    - Using and defining special python methods (dunder methods).
    - Immutable objects.
    - Making an object hashable (implementing `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods.
    - Implementing decortors in Python.
    - Class methods and static methods.
    - `__repr__()` and `__str__()` methods.

### Second part:
- Machine learning
    - Supervised learning:
        - KNN, Naive Bayes, Desision Trees, SVM, Neural Nets
    - Unsupervised learning:
        - k-Means clustering
    - Reinforcement learning
        - Q-learning

### Example problems
- Search:
    - N-Puzzle, N-Queens, TSP
